The `xcp` directory contains the Common XenServer and XCP-ng Python packages.
They are intented for use in XenServer and XCP-ng Dom0 only and deal with logging,
Hardware/PCI, networking, and other Dom0 tasks.

The package name is `python-libs` which is also the `rpm` package name in XenServer.
XCP-ng packages it as [xcp-python-libs](https://github.com/xcp-ng-rpms/xcp-python-libs)
([koji](https://koji.xcp-ng.org/packageinfo?packageID=400)).

It supports Python 2.7 and is currently in progress to get further fixes for >= 3.6.
It depends on `six`, and on Python 2.7, also `configparser` and `pyliblzma`.

## Test-driven Development (TDD) Model

Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md] for installing a local development environment.

This package has CI which can be run locally but is also run in GitHub CI to ensure
Test-driven development.

The Continuous Integration Tests feature:

- Combined coverage testing of Python 2.7 and Python 3.8 code branches
- Automatic Upload of the combined coverage to CodeCov (from the GitHub Workflow)
- Checking of the combined coverage against the diff to master: Fails if changes are not covered!
- Pylint report in the GitHub Action Summary page, with Warning and Error annotatios, even in the code review.
- Check that changes don't generate pylint warnings (if warning classes which are enabled in .pylintrc)
- Static analysis using `mypy`, `pyre` and `pytype`

This enforces that any change (besides whitespace):

- has code coverage and
- does not introduce a `pylint` warning which is not disabled in `.pylintrc`
- does not introduce a type of static analysis warning which is currently suppressed.

## Status Summary

- The warnings shown on the GitHub Actions Summary Page indicate the remaining
  work for full Pyhon3 support (excluding missing tests).

## `Pylint` results from GitHub CI in GitHub Actions page

A step of the GitHub workflow produces a browser-friendly `pylint` report:
From the [Actions tab](https://github.com/xenserver/python-libs/actions),
open a recent workflow run the latest and scroll down until you see the tables!

## Configuration files

- `pyproject.toml`: Top-level configuration of the package metadata and dependencies
- `tox.ini`: Secondary level configuration, defines of the CI executed by `tox`
- `pytest.ini`: The defaults used by `pytest` unless overruled by command line options
- `.github/workflows/main.yml`: Configuration of the GitHub CI matrix jobs and coverage upload
- `.github/act-serial.yaml`: Configuration for the jobs run by the local GitHub actions runner `act`
- `.pylintrc`: Configuration file of `Pylint`

## Installation and Setup of a development environment

For the installation of the general development dependencies, visit [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)

### Updating tests using `pytest-watch` (`ptw`)

- `pip install pytest-watch` - `ptw` watches changed files and runs `pytest` after changes are saved.
  - Then run `ptw` on the code/tests you work on, e.g.: `ptw tests/test_pci_*` and edit the files.

## Example development workflow

- Run the tests for at also with `LC_ALL=C python3.6 -m pytest` to check for any `ascii` codec
  issues by Python3.6
- Test with `python2.7 -m pytest`
- Run `mypy` (without any arguments - The configuration is in `pyproject.toml`)
- Run `./pytype_runner.py`
- Run `./pyre_runner.py`
- Run `tox -e py36-lint` and fix any `Pylint` warnings
- Run `tox -e py310-covcombine-check` and fix any missing diff-coverage.
- Run `tox` for the full CI test suite
- Run `act` for the full CI test suite in local containers (similar to GitHub action containers)
- Commit with `--signoff` on a new branch and push it and check the triggered GitHub Action run succeeds.
- Open a new PR

The list of `virtualenvs` configured in tox can be shown using this command: `tox -av`

```ml
$ tox -av
default environments:
py36-lint              -> Run in a py36 virtualenv: Run pylint and fail on warnings remaining on lines in the diff to master
py311-pyre             -> Run in a py311 virtualenv: Run pyre for static analyis, only passes using: tox -e py311-pyre
py38-pytype            -> Run in a py38 virtualenv: Run pytype for static analyis, intro: https://youtu.be/abvW0mOrDiY
py310-covcombine-check -> Run in a py310 virtualenv: Generate combined coverage reports with py27-test coverage merged Run mypy for static analyis

additional environments:
cov                    -> Run in a python virtualenv: Generate coverage html reports (incl. diff-cover) for this environment
covcp                  -> Run in a python virtualenv: Copy the generated .converage and coverage.xml to the UPLOAD_DIR dir
fox                    -> Run in a python virtualenv: Generate combined coverage html reports and open them in firefox
mdreport               -> Run in a python virtualenv: Make a test report (which is shown in the GitHub Actions Summary Page)
test                   -> Run in a python virtualenv: Run pytest in this environment with --cov for use in other stages
```

If you have only one version of Python3, that works too. Use: `tox -e py<ver>-test`

## Static analysis using mypy, pyre, pyright and pytype

The preconditions for using static analysis with `mypy` (which passes now but has
only a few type comments) and `pyright` are present now and `mypy` is enabled in `tox`
which runs the tests in GitHub CI as well. But of course, because they code is largely
still not yet typed, no strict checks can be enabled so far. However, every checker
which is possible now, is enabled.

Checking the contents of untyped functions is enabled for all but four modules which
would need more work. Look for `check_untyped_defs = false` in `pytproject.toml`.

The goal or final benefit would be to have it to ensure internal type correctness
and code quality but also to use static analysis to check the interoperability with
the calling code.

## Type annotations: Use Type comments for now

Python2.7 can't support the type annotation syntax, but until all users are migrated,
annotations in comments (type comments) can be used. They are supported by
tools like `mypy` and `pyright` (VS Code):

Quoting from <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53306458/python-3-type-hints-in-python-2>:

> Function annotations were introduced in [PEP 3107](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3107/) for Python 3.0. The usage of annotations as type hints was formalized in in [PEP 484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/) for Python 3.5+.
>
> Python < 3.0 do support the type hints syntax.
> However, PEP 484 [offers a workaround](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/#suggested-syntax-for-python-2-7-and-straddling-code)
  These type comment look like this:

```py
def get_default_device(use_gpu=True):
    # type: (bool) -> cl.Device
    ...
```

Many type checkers support this syntax: mypy, pyright/pylance, pytype

As proof, these examples show how the comment below triggers the checks:

```diff
--- a/xcp/xmlunwrap.py
+++ b/xcp/xmlunwrap.py
@@ -29,1 +29,2 @@ class XmlUnwrapError(Exception):

$ mypy xcp/xmlunwrap.py

```

pyright (used by VS Code by default):

```py
